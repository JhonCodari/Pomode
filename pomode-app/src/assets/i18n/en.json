    "WHAT_IS": {
      "TITLE": "What is it?",
      "P1": "The <strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong> is a time management method based on clear work and break intervals. You focus for <strong>25 minutes</strong>, take a <strong>5-minute</strong> break, and start the next round. After four rounds, you take a longer break of <strong>15 to 30 minutes</strong>.",
      "P2": "This way, your brain stays alert even during long work or study sessions — whether reviewing notes, preparing for exams, or working on complex projects."
    },
    "HISTORY": {
      "TITLE": "📜 History",
      "P1": "The method was created in the late 1980s by Italian student <strong>Francesco Cirillo</strong>, using a tomato-shaped kitchen timer (hence the name: <em>pomodoro</em> = tomato in Italian).",
      "P2": "Frustrated with distractions and procrastination, Cirillo began dividing his study sessions into timed blocks. What started as a personal experiment became a globally recognized method, adopted by millions of people in various professional fields."
    },
    "SCIENCE": {
      "TITLE": "🔬 What Does Science Say?",
      "INTRO": "Evidence for the effectiveness of the Pomodoro technique is based on studies in <strong>cognitive neuroscience</strong> and <strong>behavioral psychology</strong> that analyze the impact of structured breaks on the brain.",
      "BENEFITS": {
        "FATIGUE": "<strong>20% reduction in mental fatigue:</strong> Studies show that structured intervals result in less fatigue compared to self-directed breaks.",
        "PRODUCTIVITY": "<strong>25% increase in productivity:</strong> Professionals using the method report significant productivity gains, as the technique helps combat \"attention burnout\".",
        "GRADES": "<strong>Up to 12% higher grades:</strong> Academic research indicates that students using the technique perform better on exams.",
        "BALANCE": "<strong>Improved work-life balance:</strong> Individuals who adopted structured breaks reported a 15% increase in satisfaction with work-life balance."
      },
      "CONCLUSION": "The technique aligns perfectly with our brain's natural rhythms, improving cognitive function and maximizing output."
